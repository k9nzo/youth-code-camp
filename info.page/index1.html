        <h3>What is Depression?</h3>
        <p>
          Depression is a serious but treatable mental health condition that
          affects millions of people worldwide. It goes beyond feelings of
          sadness or having a bad day—it's a persistent feeling of emptiness,
          hopelessness, or despair that can last for weeks, months, or even
          years. Depression can impact every aspect of life, from work and
          relationships to physical health. Understanding depression is the
          first step in breaking the silence and removing the stigma surrounding
          it.

        <h3>Identifying Depression</h3>
        <p>
          Recognizing the signs of depression is crucial for early intervention
          and support. Common symptoms include persistent feelings of sadness,
          hopelessness, or emptiness; a loss of interest in activities once
          enjoyed; changes in appetite or sleep patterns; and fatigue or lack of
          energy. People with depression may also experience difficulty
          concentrating, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, and even thoughts
          of self-harm or suicide. If these symptoms persist for more than two
          weeks, it’s important to seek help from a mental health professional.
          Early identification and treatment can make a significant difference
          in managing depression and improving quality of life.
